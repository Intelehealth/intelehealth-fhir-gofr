# User Management

 **User management** is the module which enables the effective management of users by assigning the necessary roles and tasks to be carried out.

### Overview

!!! important "How do you manage users in gofr?"

In order to manage  user access in gofr, you need to access the **Keycloak Administration Console**. This should only be accessed by the system's Administrator.

![Alt text](../img/gofr_key_cloak.JPG 'GOFR Key CLoak Admin Console')

 From the **Admin Console**, you have a wide range of actions you can perform to manage users.

## Administrator Roles

### Managing User Roles

There are three types of user roles in gofr. They are:

* Admin role
* Data manager role
* Open role

The initial server configuration includes an **administrator** role.

This account and password should be immediately changed after installation. See the **Developer Guide** for more information.

Accounts assigned the admin role can **add users**, **configure the system**, and  undertake all the tasks of data managers.
Data manager accounts are limited to only managing data. They can share data sources and do other matching tasks.
Custom accounts with specific roles may be created in the future.

PS: Please let the community know if you have use cases for custom account roles.

The following fields are included:

#### Position

The arrow buttons in the Position column allow you to shift the priority of the credential for the user. The topmost credential has the highest priority. The priority determines which credential is displayed first after a user logs in. The default priority is 'password'.

#### Type

This column displays the type of credential, i.e. password or OTP.

#### User Label

This is an assignable label to recognize the credential when presented as a selection option during login. It can be set to any value to describe the credential.
