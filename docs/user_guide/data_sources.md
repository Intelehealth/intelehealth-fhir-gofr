### Upload CSV

In order to successfully upload a CSV file into **GOFR**

* The **CSV file** should have **headers** _(column names)_ on  the first row of the file. 
* **Empty lines** should be **removed.**

* The **CSV file** should be encoded as **Unicode (utf-8)** as that is what is used internally in the backend.

!!! Important  "If some entities are encoded in another format then matches that appear to be the same may not match as expected."

**Latitude** and **longitude** are **optional** columns. If they are included they will be used to facilitate manual matching but they are not used or required for automatic matching.

The **next step** entails **mapping the headers** on the CSV file uploaded against the headers in the GOFR system:

> **Match Headers**

Select the matching headers -> Click upload

The user may choose any levels in their hierarchy to include but they **must be ordered** with the **top most level first**.

**Click** on the **+** button to **add more levels** and map them to the appropriate levels in the app -> **Upload**

Ensure that all the column levels selected have data for all the facilities.

!!!Important "The CSV file will not be uploaded in case of missing data."

It is also possible to select no levels to match on a flat list with no hierarchy. To do so, donâ€™t select levels.

On uploading, the following warning appears:

Click **Proceed** to continue uploading or click **Cancel**, to discard.

### Remote Data Source

GOFR supports **remote sources of data**. Any **DHIS2** or **FHIR** server can be used as a source if the user has credentials to access it.

Extensive compatibility testing has not been performed but **DHIS2 versions >=2.22** should be supported. Please contact the maintainers if there is an issue.

**FHIR** is supported for **STU3** and **R4** support is anticipated.

**To add a remote data source:**

Select **Remote Source** -> Fill in the **source type** -> **Source name** -> **Base url** -> **Username** -> **Password -> Click Add**

After adding a **remote source,** users **MUST** run the **synchronization** so that the data can be pulled.

This is done in the **View data sources** feature.

**View data sources -> remote sources -> select the data source and click on 'Force full sync'.**

### Blank Source

Blank data sources can also be added. A blank data source can be **manually populated** with data by activating it on the **dashboard** and using the **facility registry** functionality to populate its contents

**To add a blank source:**

Select **Blank Source -> Add the name of the source -> Click Add**

Once uploaded, you can view all the uploaded sources under **View Data Sources** .

#### Force full Sync

Force full sync allows full synchronization of all the data from the remote source.All the data from the remote source is added.This should be done the first time a remote source is added, in order to populate data into the newly added source.

#### Sync Update

Sync Update only pulls new changes from the remote source, since the last synchronization was done. This means that any changes done in the system on the source are not overwritten by the synchronization.

!!! important "CSV entries can be edited. Any edits do not modify the original data source but the edits will be exported after reconciliation."
