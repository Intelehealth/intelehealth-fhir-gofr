# Quickstart using Docker

Docker is a fast way to get up and running with testing and trying out GOFR.

* Ensure that Docker is installed, `docker version`, and running.
* Clone the GOFR repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/intrahealth/gofr.git
# if using ssh
# git@github.com:intrahealth/gofr.git
```

* Docker Compose scripts are located in /instant/docker
```sh
cd instant/docker/run
```

Launch GOFR.
```sh
docker-compose up
```
